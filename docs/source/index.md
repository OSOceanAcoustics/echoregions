# Echoregions


Echoregions is a tool that interfaces annotations and masks for water column sonar data for machine learning developments.


## Functionalities
Current Echoregions contains functions to:
- read and organize manual annotations (lines or regions) from Echoview, which is widely used in fisheries acoustics community for labeling the presence of different animal species on echograms
- read and organize annotations stored as general dataframes
- create masks by combining the manual annotations and xarray water column sonar datasets generated by [Echopype](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype)

We plan to add additional functions to:
- create line and region annotations to interoperate ML predictions with visualization from Echoview

The underlying annotation data is stored as a Pandas dataframe, which allows users to leverage the powerful indexing and computational tools provided by Pandas.
