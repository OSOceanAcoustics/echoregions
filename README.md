EchoRegions is a tool used for parsing and utilizing region files created in EchoView.

EchoRegions is designed with [Echopype](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype) in mind, and parsed region files will be able to mask or be overlaid on top of Echopype echograms. However, the EVR, EVL, and ECS parsers do not require Echopype to be installed.

## Functionality and Usage

Please see the [API documentation](https://echoregions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) for all of the classes and functions availible in echoregions.
