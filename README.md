Echoregions is a tool that interfaces annotations from Echoview and masks for water column sonar data for Machine Learning (ML) developments. Manual annotations from Echoview are widely used in fisheries acoustics community for labeling the presence of different animal species, and the presence of bottoms on echograms. Echoregions is designed to be used as an intermediate software between Echoview annotation data products and conventional Python Machine Learning data products. The end goal for Echoregions is to allow the user to easily go from Echoview -> ML data products, and ML -> Echoview data products. Presently, the Echoview -> ML data products pipeline has been built.

## Functionalities

As of now, Echoregions contains functions to:
- Read, organize, and store Echoview manual annotations
- Create masks by combining the manual annotations and xarray water column sonar datasets generated by [Echopype](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype)

We plan to add additional functions to build the ML -> Echoview data products pipeline. This will allow the user to create bottom and region annotations from ML predictions and convert to a format that can be easily visualized and manipulated in Echoview.

The underlying annotation data is stored as a Pandas dataframe, which allows users to leverage the powerful indexing and computational tools provided by Pandas.
