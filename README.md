# EchoRegions

EchoRegions is a tool used for parsing and utilizing region files created in EchoView.

EchoRegions is designed with [Echopype](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype) in mind and, parsed region files will be able to mask or be overlaid on top of Echopype echograms. However, the EVR, EVL, and ECS parsers do not require Echopype to be installed.
